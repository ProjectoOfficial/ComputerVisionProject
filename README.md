### Abstract
<p>In this project we want to implement a series of solutions that could be an integral part of an autonomous driving system. The aim of the project is to analyze the road context, recognize the surrounding objects and predict an accident risk.
Our system is based on a data processing pipeline that starts from the acquisition of images by a camera, or from a dataset, through imaging processing stages and neural networks.</p>
<p>In the first part of the pipeline, the data can come from two different sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>data acquired by a camera</li>
<li>data from one or more datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, the images are processed through geometric transformations and preprocessing phases, to be prepared for processing by the neural networks.
The neural networks that we are going to implement will be an Object detector with the aim of identifying the objects present in the road context.</p> 
<p>Next we will analyze the type of traffic present inside the scene and finally we will use the data coming from the object detector to make position forecasting of the moving objects in the scene, with the aim of preventing a possible accident.</p>

### Real Time Camera
<p>Thanks to the collaboration between Projecto and <a href="https://www.e-consystems.com/"> e-con Systems </a>for this project we will use the <a href="https://www.e-consystems.com/usb-cameras/sony-starvis-imx462-ultra-low-light-camera.asp"><i> See3CAM_CU27 - Sony® Starvis ™ IMX462 Ultra Low Light USB 3.1 Gen 1 Room</i></a>.</p>
<p>We have chosen to use a night vision camera to then be able to test the pipeline that we are going to develop also in a night context. </p>
